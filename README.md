## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets and metadata used in the analysis.
- `scripts/`: Includes all scripts used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- `output/`: results generated from the analysis, specifically the figures and tables.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation related to the project.
- `LICENSE`: Information about the licensing of the code and data.

Each paper section is given a subfolder within each folder when necessarily with the sections being:

- field_populations
   - choice intake target experiment
   - no choice intake target experiment
- field_cages
   - grass nutrient analysis
   - locust survival, growth analysis
   - locust intake target analyis
- spatial_modeling
   - fishnet grid construction
   - remote sensing data extraction
   - raw data visualization
   - modeling
   - post modeling visualization

Notebooks are numbered and for each respective folder, it starts with `01` and on.

## Requirements

The code and analysis were developed using the following software and libraries:
- Python 3.x
- R 4.x
- [List of key libraries, e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, ggplot2]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
    cd repository-name
    ```
2. Install the required Python and R packages:
    ```bash
