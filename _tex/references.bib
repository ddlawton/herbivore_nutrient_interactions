              Population dynamics theory forms the quantitative core from which most ecologists have developed their intuition about how species interactions, heterogeneity, and biodiversity play out in time. Throughout its development, theoretical population biology has built on variants of the Lotka–Volterra equations and in nearly all cases has taken a single‐currency approach to understanding population change, abstracting populations as aggregations of individuals or biomass. In this review, we explore how depicting organisms as built of more than one thing (for example, C and an important nutrient, such as P) in stoichiometrically explicit models results in qualitatively different predictions about the resulting dynamics. Fundamentally, stoichiometric models incorporate both food quantity and food quality effects in a single framework, allow key feedbacks such as consumer‐driven nutrient recycling to occur, and generally appear to stabilize predator–prey systems while simultaneously producing rich dynamics with alternative domains of attraction and occasionally counterintuitive outcomes, such as coexistence of more than one predator species on a single‐prey item and decreased herbivore performance in response to increased light intensity experienced by the autotrophs. In addition to the theoretical background, we also review recent laboratory and field studies considering stoichiometric effects on autotroph–herbivore systems, emphasizing algae–
              Daphnia
              interactions. These studies support the predictions of stoichiometric theory, providing empirical evidence for alternative stable states under stoichiometric constraints, for negative effects of solar radiation on herbivores via stoichiometric food quality, and for diversity‐enhancing effects of poor food quality. Stoichiometric theory has strong potential for both quantitative and qualitative improvements in the predictive power of population ecology, a major priority in light of the multivariate anthropogenic and natural perturbations experienced by populations. However, full development and testing of stoichiometric population dynamics theory will require greater intellectual tolerance and exchange between researchers working in ecosystem and population ecology.},

              Food resources are often critical regulating factors affecting individual fitness and population densities. In the Himalayan Mountains, Bharal “blue sheep” (
              Pseudois nayaur
              ) are the main food resource for the endangered snow leopard (
              Panthera uncia
              ), as well as being preyed upon by other predators. Blue sheep, however, may face a number of challenges including food resource competition with other wild and domestic ungulates, and hunting pressure. Here, we characterized the diet of blue sheep in the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) of Nepal and conducted proximate nutritional analysis on a limited number of plants identified as foods. Furthermore, we investigated the macronutrient and fiber balance of these plants using nutritional geometry which is a state‐space approach to modeling multidimensional and interactive nutritional aspects of foraging. A total of 19 plant species/genera were identified in blue sheep pellets using microhistological analysis. On average, across seasons and regions of the study area, the two most frequently occurring plants in pellets were graminoids:
              Kobressia
              sp. and
              Carex
              spp. The macronutrient balance of
              Kobresia
              sp. was relatively high in carbohydrate and low in protein, while other plants in the diet were generally higher in protein and lipid content. Analysis of fiber balance showed that the two most consumed plants of blue sheep (
              i.e
              .,
              Kobresia
              spp. and
              Carex
              spp.) contained the highest concentration of hemicellulose, which is likely digestible by blue sheep. The hemicellulose and lignin balance of plants ranged relatively widely, yet their cellulose contents showed less variation. Foraging by blue sheep may therefore be a balance between consuming highly digestible high‐carbohydrate plants and plants less‐digestible but higher in protein and/or lipid.},

However, the extent and patterns of entomophagy vary substantially both in humans and nonhuman primates. Here we synthesize the literature to examine why humans and other primates eat insects and what accounts for the variation in the extent to which they do so. Variation in the availability of insects is clearly important, but less understood is the role of nutrients in entomophagy. We apply a multidimensional analytical approach, the right-angled mixture triangle, to published data on the macronutrient compositions of insects to address this. Results showed that insects eaten by humans spanned a wide range of protein-to-fat ratios but were generally nutrient dense, whereas insects with high protein-to-fat ratios were eaten by nonhuman primates. Although suggestive, our survey exposes a need for additional, standardized, data.},

This suggest that nutritional factors control the timing of breeding, but until now there has been no indication of which nutrients are responsible. This paper reports the results of experiments conducted to test the following hypotheses: (1) grass seeds will not support extensive reproduction by California voles, and (2) low calcium and sodium concentrations in grass seeds can account for reduced reproduction on seed diets. In 12—wk feeding trials neither multiparous adults nor nulliparous subadults produced as many pups when fed grass seeds as when fed a laboratory diet (rabbit chow). Subadults fed grass shoots had intermediate success. Concentrations of calcium and sodium, but not protein and phosphorus, were lower in seeds than in rabbit chow, grass shoots, and diets recommended for laboratory rodents. Subadult animals had positive net balances of nitrogen and phosphorus, but not of calcium and sodium, when fed grass seeds. Although subadult females generally produced fewer young than adult females, subadult voles fed grass seeds and supplemental calcium and sodium in their drinking water reproduced as well as adult voles fed rabbit pellets. All these results were consistent with the hypotheses given above and lend credence to previous suggestions that nutrition (particularly mineral nutrition) exerts important influences on the population densities of lemmings and voles.},

Although it is well recognized that development and body size can have strong and predictable effects on many aspects of organismal function, we lack a predictive understanding of ontogenetic or scaling effects on macronutrient intake. We determined protein and carbohydrate intake throughout development on lab populations of locusts and compared to late instars of field populations. Self-selected protein:carbohydrate targets declined dramatically through ontogeny, due primarily to declines in mass-specific protein consumption rates which were highly correlated with declines in specific growth rates. Lab results for protein consumption rates partly matched results from field-collected locusts. However, field locusts consumed nearly double the carbohydrate, likely due to higher activity and metabolic rates. Combining our results with the available data for animals, both across species and during ontogeny, protein consumption scaled predictably and hypometrically, demonstrating a new scaling rule key for understanding nutritional ecology.},

abstract = {Abstract. A framework is presented for the study of feeding behaviour in the context of the multiple nutrient requirements of animals. Each nutrient required is represented by a single axis in a multi-dimensional plot. At any time the tissues will require a particular quantity and mix of nutrients. This ideal point is termed the 'nutritional target'. Meeting it involves the regulation of feeding behaviour and processing of ingested food. The ideal mix and quantity of nutrients that needs to be ingested to achieve the nutritional target is termed the 'intake target'. When fed a single food with a fixed proportion of nutrients, an animal is effectively restricted to a 'rail' in the nutritional space. Depending on this rail's slope, the intake target may not be achievable, in which case the animal should reach some optimal point of compromise on the rail. Considered together, the points of best compromise for a range of different rails will form an array on the plane, the shape and position of which, relative to the intake target, reveal the functional rule expressed by the physiological controlling mechanisms. Such concepts were investigated experimentally using locust, Locusta migratoria L., nymphs. Insects were given one of 25 artificial foods, containing one of five levels each of protein and digestible carbohydrate, and intake and growth were recorded across the fifth stadium. Two-dimensional plots of nutrient intake and growth were used to estimate the position of the intake and nutritional targets. On the basis of the array of intakes and estimates of the position of targets it was possible to test hypotheses about the functional rules employed by locusts to regulate their intake of nutrients. Both protein and carbohydrate intake were regulated equally efficiently. Locusts appeared to eat a given food such that they reached the geometrically closest point on their nutritional rail to the intake target ('closest distance optimization'). They 'jumped rails' by differentially utilizing ingested food and were thereby able to reach the growth component of the nutritional target (the 'growth target'). Only on extremely unbalanced foods did insects have a longer instar. The proximate mechanisms controlling the patterns are discussed. A simple, model animal is generated which is capable of making these sophisticated behavioural decisions without requiring a complex, central command centre.}

Amounts eaten, defaecated and grown were measured across the fifth stadium. Results showed that locusts differentially utilized ingested protein and carbohydrate and consequently achieved similar growth on all four diets despite having ingested very different amounts of protein and carbohydrate. Nutrients in excess of requirements were voided from the animal mainly after digestion and absorption from the gut. In the case of excess nitrogen, a major route for removal was through increased uric acid excretion, while for carbohydrate the major removal mechanism was apparently via respiration.},

Most insect herbivores strongly regulate their nutrient intake when given the opportunity.

Insect herbivores also regularly encounter allelochemicals as they eat, and recent work indicates the effect an allelochemical has on nutrient regulation, and insect herbivore performance, is modified depending on a food's nutrient composition. Comparative studies of nutrient regulation suggest coexisting generalist herbivores occupy unique nutritional feeding niches, and work with pathogens and parasitoids has revealed the manner in which top-down pressures influence patterns of nutrient intake. Insect herbivores regulate their nutrient intake using pre- and postingestive mechanisms, plus learning, and there is evidence that some of these mechanisms are shaped by natural selection.},

However, a problem arises for understanding coexistence of multiple species if they share critical resources too generally. Here, we employ an experimental framework grounded in nutritional physiology to show that closely related, cooccurring and generalist-feeding herbivores (seven grasshopper species in the genus Melanoplus; Orthoptera: Acrididae) eat protein and carbohydrate in different absolute amounts and ratios even if they eat the same plant taxa. The existence of species-specific nutritional niches provides a cryptic mechanism that helps explain how generalist herbivores with broadly overlapping diets might coexist. We also show that performance by grasshoppers allowed to mix their diets and thus regulate their protein–carbohydrate intake matched optimal performance peaks generated from no-choice treatments. These results indicate the active nature of diet selection to achieve balanced diets and provide buffering capacity in the face of variable food quality. Our empirical findings and experimental approach can be extended to generate and test predictions concerning the intensity of biotic interactions between species, the relative abundance of species, yearly fluctuations in population size, and the nature of interactions with natural enemies in tritrophic niche space.}}

abstract = {Livestock grazing can have a strong impact on herbivore abundance, distribution and community. However, not all species of herbivores respond the same way to livestock grazing, and we still have a poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving these differential responses. Here, we investigate the effect of light intensity cattle grazing on the abundance of two grasshoppers (Euchorthippus cheui and E. unicolor) that co-occur in the same grasslands and feed on the same food plant (the dominant grass Leymus chinensis). The two grasshopper species differ in phenology so that their peak abundances are separated into early- and late-growing seasons. We used an exclosure experiment to monitor grasshopper abundance and food quality in the field under grazed and ungrazed conditions, and performed feeding trials to examine grasshopper preference for grazed or ungrazed food plants in the laboratory. We found that the nitrogen content of L. chinensis leaves continuously declined in the ungrazed areas, but was significantly enhanced by cattle grazing over the growing season. Cattle grazing facilitated the early-season grasshopper E. cheui, whereas it suppressed the late-season grasshopper E. unicolor. Moreover, feeding trials showed that E. cheui preferred L. chinensis from grazed plots, while E. unicolor preferred the leaves from ungrazed plots. We conclude that livestock grazing has opposite effects on the two grasshopper species, and that these effects may be driven by grazing-induced changes in plant nutrient content and the unique nutritional niches of the grasshoppers. These results suggest that insects that belong to the same guild can have opposite nutrient requirements, related to their distinct phenologies, and that this can ultimately affect their response to cattle grazing. Our results show that phenology may link insect physiological needs to local resource availabilities, and should be given more attention in future work on interactions between large herbivores and insects.},

While it is well documented that insects from different feeding guilds (e.g., sap-feeders and leaf-chewers) can respond differently to altered food resources due to their distinct physiological and ecological characteristics, little is known about how ecologically similar insect species from the same feeding guild respond to changes in food nutrient status. Using nitrogen (N) fertiliser, the authors examined the effects of N inputs on two sympatric grasshopper species, Euchorthippus cheui and E. unicolor, that share the same host food plant, Leymus chinensis grass. The authors examined the effects of fertilisation on the individual feeding behaviour, performance and abundance of the two grasshopper species. The nutrient (protein) content of L. chinensis leaves was enhanced by fertilisation during the entire season. However, E. cheui and E. unicolor exhibited differing growth rates, development and body size responses to fertilisation. E. cheui preferred L. chinensis leaves from high-N fertilised treatments, while E. unicolor preferred leaves from low-N fertilised treatments. Moreover, fertilisation increased the abundance of E. cheui but had no significant effect on the abundance of E. unicolor in the field. The findings imply that effective management and conservation strategies for insects should target the needs of individual species rather than species groups or communities as a whole because nutritional and environmental requirements are often species-specific.},

In this study, we investigated the effects of plant protein and carbohydrate availability on plant selection and performance for a migratory generalist herbivore, the Australian plague locust,

Using a full factorial design, we ran both choice and no-choice experiments to measure preference and performance. We confirmed locust preference for plants with a lower protein-carbohydrate ratio (unfertilized plants). Unlike previous studies with mature wild grass species, we found that intact plants supported better performance than dried and ground plants, suggesting that cell wall removal may only improve performance for tougher or more carbohydrate-rich plants. These results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that several migratory herbivorous species perform better on plants with a lower protein:carbohydrate ratio.},

	abstract = {Locusts are grasshoppers that can migrate en masse and devastate food security. Plant nutrient content is a key variable influencing population dynamics, but the relationship is not straightforward. For an herbivore, plant quality depends not only on the balance of nutrients and antinutrients in plant tissues, which is influenced by land use and climate change, but also on the nutritional state and demands of the herbivore, as well as its capacity to extract nutrients from host plants. In contrast to the concept of a positive relationship between nitrogen or protein concentration and herbivore performance, a five-decade review of lab and field studies indicates that equating plant N to plant quality is misleading because grasshoppers respond negatively or neutrally to increasing plant N just as often as they respond positively. For locusts specifically, low-N environments are actually beneficial because they supply high energy rates that support migration. Therefore, intensive land use, such as continuous grazing or cropping, and elevated ambient CO

              Current paradigms generally assume that increased plant nitrogen (N) should enhance herbivore performance by relieving protein limitation, increasing herbivorous insect populations. We show, in contrast to this scenario, that host plant N enrichment and high-protein artificial diets decreased the size and viability of
              Oedaleus asiaticus
              , a dominant locust of north Asian grasslands. This locust preferred plants with low N content and artificial diets with low protein and high carbohydrate content. Plant N content was lowest and locust abundance highest in heavily livestock-grazed fields where soils were N-depleted, likely due to enhanced erosion. These results suggest that heavy livestock grazing and consequent steppe degradation in the Eurasian grassland promote outbreaks of this locust by reducing plant protein content.},

We manipulated dietary P content (\% P) over its observed range in terrestrial foliage using artificial diets containing near-optimal contents of other nutrients for the grasshopper Schistocerca americana. Over much of the ecologically relevant range, when consuming single diets over a lifetime, higher P stimulated growth rates and increased survival, with an optimal dietary \% P of 0.25-0.50\% when measured throughout development. Excessive dietary P (1\%) reduced growth and survival. However, with only short-term (3 day) confinement to single diets, dietary P had no effect on food consumption or growth rates. During these short exposures, fifth (but not third) instar hoppers increased the proportion of P excreted relative to P assimilated as dietary P increased. Target experiments demonstrated that, when given a choice, grasshoppers select among foods to attain a P intake target of 0.6\%.

The numbers of adults produced in one generation are directly related to the total rainfall during a period of three weeks at the time of hatching and can be predicted by a linear regression of adult numbers on rainfall. The evidence suggests that rain favours the survival of nymphs immediately after hatching by influencing the growth of food-plants. The ecological factors that cause discrepanices between the observed numbers and those predicted by regression are discussed. Among these are immigration, qualitative changes such as the development of hopper bands and the build-up of natural enemies, combined with errors in the selection of suitable oviposition sites by the locusts themselves. Despite intermittent droughts, the range of fluctuation of numbers of C. terminifera is limited in this region, and in the long term average numbers are high.},

	abstract = {Summary
            The interaction between temperature and diet quality can affect the life-history of ectotherms. The rate and ratio at which protein and carbohydrate are obtained from food are an important aspect of diet quality, and insects have a well-developed capacity to adjust their feeding behaviour and postingestive physiology to regulate intake and allocation of these nutrients. If the supply of protein and carbohydrate varies with temperature (e.g. via effects on intake, digestion or metabolism), then herbivorous insects can use thermoregulatory behaviour to help achieve nutritional homeostasis. When fed the host grass Triticum aestivum, Locusta migratoria nymphs absorbed and allocated protein and carbohydrate to growth with the same efficiency at 38°C as at 32°C, however, at the higher temperature, they ingested more food. In contrast, when feeding on Themeda triandra, the nymphs absorbed carbohydrate with higher efficiency at 32°C and protein at 38°C. Using synthetic diets, we induced either a protein or a carbohydrate deficiency in experimental insects and showed that locusts placed in a thermal gradient following a meal of T. triandra selected 32°C when deprived of carbohydrate, and 38°C when protein-deficient. This capacity to use thermoregulatory behaviour to redress an imposed nutritional imbalance improved with experience of feeding on T. triandra. As predicted, locusts fed T. aestivum always chose higher temperatures, irrespective of nutritional state. Our results have consequences for understanding host plant choice by herbivores and interpreting the effects of changed environmental temperatures and microclimate on animal-plant interactions.},

                    The Australian plague locust,
                    Chortoicetes terminifera
                    , develops following rainfall in an environment dominated by two host plants, the annual
                    Dactyloctenium radulans
                    and the perennial
                    Astrebla lappacea.
                    This simple system provides an ideal opportunity to explore the relationship between plant quality, individual herbivore performance and population responses.
                  
                
                
                  We compared the two grasses chemically and structurally, and the behavioural, physiological and developmental responses of locust nymphs to these diets.
                
                
                  
                    The grasses appeared to be of similar nutritional quality in terms of their chemical composition, although they differed in their physical properties. Early instar nymphs performed equally well on both grasses. However, older nymphs consuming
                    D. radulans
                    developed faster, survived better and attained a higher body weight compared with those consuming
                    A. lappacea
                    .
                  
                
                
                  
                    The differences in performance by the older nymphs related to the rate and ratio of supply of carbohydrate and protein from the two grasses, with less carbohydrate being assimilated from
                    A. lappacea
                    than
                    D. radulans
                    per unit of protein assimilated. Experiments showed that these differences arose as a direct result of the physical barrier to nutrient extraction provided by cell walls and indirectly through the amount of water contained within each cell. Paradoxically, nitrogen did not limit performance in the traditional sense through shortage, but rather its relative excess in
                    A. lappacea
                    appeared to impede intake and assimilation of adequate carbohydrate.
                  
                
                
                  
                    As a consequence, we predict that the length of time
                    D. radulans
                    remains available following rainfall will influence plaguing dynamics, although not for the reasons previously thought.
                  
                
                
                  The results highlight the need to consider nutrient balance and actual rates of supply (rather than simply measuring the chemical composition of the plant) when attempting to understand herbivore nutritional ecology.},

            Top-down effects, like predation, are drivers of insect outbreaks, but bottom-up effects, like host nutritional quality, also influence outbreaks and could in turn be altered by insect-caused defoliation. We evaluated the prediction that herbivory leads to a positive feedback on outbreak severity as nutrient concentration in plant tissues increases through improved soil nutrient availability from frass and litter deposition. Over seven years of a spruce budworm outbreak, we quantified litter nutrient fluxes, soil nitrogen availability, and host tree foliar nutrient status along a forest susceptibility gradient. As the outbreak progressed, both soil nutrient fluxes and availability increased which, in turn, improved foliage quality in surviving host trees. This is consistent with boosted insect fitness and increased population density and defoliation as outbreaks grow. Our results suggest that a positive bottom-up feedback to forest ecosystems from defoliation may result in conditions favorable to self-amplifying population dynamics in insect herbivores that can contribute to driving broad-scale outbreaks.},

              The Australian Plague Locust Commission (APLC) is responsible for the monitoring and control of locust populations that pose a threat to agriculture in the inland areas of four Australian States, a total area of 2 million km2. A GIS‐based decision support system (DSS) is used to co‐ordinate the collection, processing, analysis and display of a range of spatial data for the forecasting of locust population development and to assist control operations. The resultant forecasts are used to help locate population aggregations early in a breeding sequence so as to enable effective preventive control. The data collection components of the DSS include wireless direct transfer of locust survey data from the field and daily internet collections of weather data. Locust distribution and age information is collected by APLC officers on regular vehicle surveys using GPS‐connected palmtop computers, and sent directly to a GIS server via high frequency (HF) radio modems. Locust reports from landholders and state extension staff are also incorporated into the system. The current survey data are used to estimate broad distributions, and to seed spatially‐explicit development models that can identify the timing of life stages that can be effectively managed. Information on the distribution of rainfall, temperature and wind‐fields is collected automatically from the internet and integrated with habitat information and locust distributions. Online weather data products from the Bureau of Meterology are also accessed regularly to assist in operational decision making.},

	abstract = {Variation in resource abundance affects population dynamics by altering demographic processes and interactions among individuals in the population. For small mammals, food is likely to be a critical resource. Population densities should vary directly with food abundance, but the underlying demographic changes are more difficult to predict. We experimentally increased food available to populations of hispid cotton rats, Sigmodon hispidus, to examine how rates of recruitment and disappearance varied with food abundance. We expected supplemental food to increase winter survival and to increase recruitment, perhaps advancing the date of first reproduction in the spring. We also thought larger, behaviorally dominant animals might dominate the point sources of supplemental food, altering age or size ratios and producing an excess of transient animals. Supplemental food increased population densities but did not dampen pronounced seasonal fluctuations. Supplemented populations contained proportionately more juveniles and small adults than did controls; social behavior may have limited increases in numbers of large adults. Survival rates did not change; density increases were due to increased reproduction and immigration. In supplemented populations, reproductive effort by females increased, but the proportion of reproductive females decreased. Reproductive females and nonreproductive animals of both sexes were less likely to be transients than were reproductive males. Transients constituted higher proportions of control populations because of successful settlement, primarily by juveniles and small adults, into supplemented areas. The strongly seasonal climatic conditions under which northern S. hispidus populations exist produce contrasting selective pressures which might favor season—specific foraging strategies. Our data support a scenario of territorial females and wandering males in the reproductive season, with females maximizing resource acquisition for production of offspring. During winter, both sexes may restrict foraging time (and exposure to predators and weather) to the minimum required for survival.},

The density-disturbing effects of migration were over-compensated by the delayed effects of natural enemies on immature survival. There was no evidence that the amplitude of fluctuations was controlled at any stage by density-dependent processes, even at the highest densities encountered. Gregarization, although density-dependent and leading to daytime emigration: rarely stabilized population peaks because swarming populations remained relatively static. Densities never reached the carrying capacity of the habitats, even locally, because of the frequency of emigration at night. Local population extinctions due to emigration and low productivity were compensated by eventual immigration at night in favourable weather. In neither situation was the size of night migration shown to be density-dependent, although a spurious effect was detected. Variations in natality and survival had little influence on local population trends but, when synchronized over large areas by unusually favourable weather, influenced the course of large-scale fluctuations. Regional populations were more stable than local ones, due to spatial and temporal differences in reproductive success in a heterogeneous environment, and to peripheral emigration losses. Variations in the synoptic circulation and rainfall at the times of migration and reproduction cause stochastic processes to exert a major control of regional population fluctuations in the Australian plague locust.},

	abstract = {Increasing grazing pressure and climate change affect nitrogen (N) dynamics of grassland ecosystems in the Eurasian steppe belt with unclear consequences for future delivery of essential services such as forage production, C sequestration, and diversity conservation. The identification of key processes responsive to grazing is crucial to optimize grassland management. In this comprehensive case study of a Chinese typical steppe, we present an in‐depth analysis of grazing effects on N dynamics, including the balance of N gains and losses, and N cycling. N pools and fluxes were simultaneously quantified on three grassland sites of different long‐term grazing intensities.
            
              Dust deposition, wind erosion, and wet deposition were the predominant but most variable processes contributing to N losses and gains. Heavy grazing increased the risk of N losses by wind erosion. Hay‐making and sheep excrement export to folds during nighttime keeping were important pathways of N losses from grassland sites. Compared to these fluxes, gaseous N losses (N

Heavy grazing reduced pool sizes of topsoil organic N, above‐ and belowground biomass, and N fluxes with regard to plant N uptake, decomposition, gross microbial N turnover, and immobilization. Most N‐related processes were more intensive in seasons of higher water availability, indicating complex interactions between land use intensity and climate variability. The projected increase of atmospheric N depositions and changes in rainfall pattern imposed by land use change will likely affect N sink–source pathways and N flux dynamics, indicating high potential impact on grassland ecosystem functions. Land use practices will be increasingly important for the management of N dynamics in Chinese typical steppe and, therefore, must be considered as key component to maintain, restore or optimize ecosystem services.},

            Breeding success in birds may be determined by the availability of food that parents can provide to growing nestlings. A standard method for testing the occurrence of food limitation is to provide supplemental food during different parts of the breeding period. If there is spatial variation in the strength of food limitation, the effect of such an experiment should also vary spatially. We investigated whether the strength of food limitation during nestling rearing in the European Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) was related to the management intensity of agricultural landscapes. We fed birds mealworms during the nestling period in landscapes with high or low local availability of pasture, the preferred foraging habitat. Both habitat and food supplementation affected growth and survival of nestlings; the effects of the food-supplementation experiment were generally stronger than those of habitat. Mortality mainly struck the last-hatched chick. Both habitat and food supplementation positively affected nestling growth, measured as nestling tarsus length. In addition, food supplementation positively affected feather growth and asymptotic mass. Contrary to expectation, no interactions existed between effects of habitat and food supplementation, which suggests that breeding success was limited by food availability in both landscapes. Potential reasons for this lack of effect are parental compensation and low statistical power. Also, breeding densities were higher in landscapes with more pastures, possibly equalizing the per-capita availability of food. Thus, our results demonstrate that reproductive success was limited by availability of food when local availability of preferred foraging habitat was either low or high, but fail to demonstrate spatial variation in the strength of food limitation.

	abstract = {The Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA) is the first continental version of the GlobalSoilMap concept and the first nationally consistent, fine spatial resolution set of continuous soil attributes with Australia-wide coverage. The SLGA relies on digital soil mapping methods and integrates historical soil data, new measurement with spectroscopic sensors, novel spatial modelling and a web-service delivery architecture. The SLGA provides soil, regolith and landscape estimates at the centre point of 3 arcsecond grid cells ({\textasciitilde}90 × 90 m) across Australia. At each point, there are estimates of 11 soil attributes and confidence intervals for each estimate to a depth of 2 m or less, depth of regolith and a set of terrain descriptors. The information system also includes a library of mid-infrared spectra, an inference engine that allows estimation of additional soil parameters and an information model that enables users to access the system via web services. The explicit mapping of depth, bulk density and coarse fragments allows estimation of material stores and fluxes on a volumetric basis. The SLGA therefore has immediate applications in carbon, nitrogen and water process modelling. The map of regolith depth will find immediate application to studies of vadose zone processes, including solute transport, groundwater and nutrient fluxes beyond the root zone. Landscape attributes at 1 and 3 arcseconds are useful for a wide spectrum of ecological, hydrological and broader environmental applications. The SLGA can be accessed at no cost from www.csiro.au/soil-and-landscape-grid. It is managed and delivered as part of the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS).},

              Simultaneous inference is a common problem in many areas of application. If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of rejecting erroneously at least one of them increases beyond the pre‐specified significance level. Simultaneous inference procedures have to be used which adjust for multiplicity and thus control the overall type I error rate. In this paper we describe simultaneous inference procedures in general parametric models, where the experimental questions are specified through a linear combination of elemental model parameters. The framework described here is quite general and extends the canonical theory of multiple comparison procedures in ANOVA models to linear regression problems, generalized linear models, linear mixed effects models, the Cox model, robust linear models, etc. Several examples using a variety of different statistical models illustrate the breadth of the results. For the analyses we use the

	abstract = {The relationship between plant nutrient content and insect herbivore populations and community structure has long interested ecologists. Insect herbivores require multiple nutrients, but ecologists have focused mostly on nitrogen (an estimate of plant protein content), and more recently phosphorus (P); other nutrients have received little attention. Here we document nutrient variation in grass and forb samples from grassland habitats in central Nebraska using an elemental approach; in total we measured foliar concentrations of 12 elements (N and P, plus S, B, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu). We detected significant variability among sites for N, P, Mg, Na, K, and Cu. We next used a model selection approach to explore how this nutritional variation and plant biomass correlate with grasshopper densities (collectively and at the feeding‐guild level), and principal component analysis to explore nutrient correlations with grasshopper community species composition. When all grasshoppers were pooled, densities varied among sites, but only P was associated with abundance of the elements shown to vary between sites. Different responses occurred at the feeding‐guild level. For grass specialists, densities were associated with N, plus P, Mg, and Na. For forb specialists, N and P were often associated with density, but associations with Na and K were also observed. Finally, mixed‐feeder abundance was strongly associated with biomass, and to a lesser extent P, Mg, Na, and Cu. At the community level, B, Ca, Zn, and Cu, plus biomass, explained {\textgreater}30\% of species composition variation. Our results confirm the positive association of N and P with insect herbivore populations, while suggesting a potential role for Mg, Na, and K. They also demonstrate the importance of exploring effects at the feeding‐guild level. We hope our data motivate ecologists to think beyond N and P when considering plant nutrient effects on insect herbivores, and make a call for studies to examine functional responses of insect herbivores to dietary manipulation of Mg, Na, and K. Finally, our results demonstrate correlations between variation in nutrients and species assemblages, but factors not linked to plant nutrient quality or biomass likely explain most of the observed variation.},

              1. Factors affecting the nutritional ecology of mixed‐feeding, polyphagous herbivores are poorly understood. Mixed‐feeding herbivores do better when they consume both forb and grass species although they typically feed primarily on forbs, which are of relatively higher protein content than grasses.
            
            
              2. In a field experiment, we examined the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization and associated changes in host‐plant C:N:P on proportional grass consumption by a mixed‐feeding insect herbivore,
              Melanoplus bivittatus
              , using natural abundance stable carbon isotope (
              12
              C
              /13
              C) methods. We also examined a grass‐feeding (
              Phoetaliotes nebrascensis
              ) and forb‐feeding (
              Hesperotettix viridis
              ) species.
            
            
              3. The C isotope signatures of
              M. bivittatus
              collected from plots fertilized with nitrogen (+N), phosphorus (+P), nitrogen and phosphorus (+N+P) and no fertilizer were compared with the C isotope signatures of plants in those plots to determine the proportion of assimilated C derived from C
              4
              grasses and C
              3
              forbs in each plot. We also examined the relationship between
              M. bivittatus
              diets and plant C:N:P stoichiometry.
            
            4. The proportion of grass assimilated approximately doubled in N‐fertilized treatments (39.1 ± 0.1\%) compared with non‐fertilized treatments (19 ± {\textless}0.1\%), an increase associated with decreased C:N and increased N:P of grasses.
            
              5. These results indicate that mixed‐feeding
              M. bivittatus
              can selectively feed to balance C:N:P intake even when choosing between two structurally and chemically different groups of plants.
            
            6. The strong relationship between diet selection and grass stoichiometry also suggests that plant nutrient composition may be more important than defensive chemistry in food choice.},

            Animal populations must be able to acquire an adequate amount of nutrients to persist regardless of what environment they are in. In highly variable environments, such as drylands where food sources are limited, this potential mismatch between physiological demands and what is available in the environment is accentuated. For herbivores, the balance of macronutrients (protein and carbohydrate) is particularly important and both nutrients are highly variable in plants both spatially and temporally. Whereas it is known that many herbivores will forage multiple plants to achieve an optimal nutritional ratio (termed the intake target), it is less known how herbivores with different life history strategies address this in variable environments. In this study, we measured the intake targets of three grasshopper species with differing life history strategies, two migratory and one non‐migratory, at three locations in New South Wales, Australia. We measured nutrient variation in plants spatially and temporally by sampling three different locations and repeated the measurement twice for one of these locations. At all three locations and both times, host plant protein differed substantially but carbohydrate content remained constant. The non‐migratory grasshopper species shifted their intake target, presumably to redress nutrient imbalances. On the other hand, the two migratory grasshopper species largely maintained the same intake target, even when in a nutritionally suboptimal environment. These results suggest that non‐migratory species are likely more limited in their capacity to forage for optimal diets and may rely more on digestion to survive in nutritionally suboptimal locations. In contrast, migratory grasshoppers may migrate to obtain the nutrients they need instead of redressing imbalances locally. Therefore, a strong metapopulation structure may aid in the persistence of migratory species at larger spatial scales. Since herbivores, especially insects, are important from nutrient cycling to food chains, understanding how populations persist in nutritionally variable environments is important to the overall ecosystem functioning. Further research should consider how nutritional demands drive population dynamics and how it changes with life history strategies.},

	abstract = {Ecological phenomena operate at different spatial scales and are not uniform across landscapes or through time. One ecological theory that attempts to account for scaling and spatiotemporal variances is hierarchical patch dynamics. It introduces a hierarchical patch network with smaller spatiotemporal scales being nested within larger scales. However, few studies have modeled its presence within animal population dynamics. Locusts are an excellent model for investigating the spatiotemporal hierarchy of animal population dynamics, due to their high migratory capacity, large geographic ranges that extend across widely differing environments, and available long‐term data on distributions. Here, we investigated the influence of preceding vegetation growth on desert locust
              Schistocerca gregaria
              and Australian plague locust
              Chortoicetes terminifera
              outbreaks on three spatial levels (species range {\textgreater} geographic region {\textgreater} land unit) and between seasons. Both species are dryland herbivores with population dynamics linked to habitat productivity pulses after rain. We used NDVI data (MODIS imagery) as a measure of vegetation growth in hierarchical generalized additive models at different scales. Locust outbreaks were either preceded by vegetation growth between 78 and 32 days (Australian plague locusts) or 32 and 20 days before (desert locust) the observation. Although prior vegetation growth characterized outbreaks of both species, the temporal pattern of NDVI differed between spatiotemporal levels. All model selection criteria selected for a similar spatial hierarchy for both species: geographic region {\textgreater} land unit which supports the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm. Further, it illuminates important timing differences between geographic regions and land units for preceding vegetation growth and locust outbreaks which can help locust managers identify when and where outbreaks occur. By acknowledging the spatiotemporal patterning of locust abundance, we account for heterogeneity of population dynamics throughout species ranges. Our findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating spatiotemporal variation in population models of insects and other animals.},

                  Access to high‐quality food is a main driver of population dynamics. For herbivores, protein and carbohydrates are key nutrients that are notoriously variable in plants and are affected by land use. However, few studies have linked foraging decisions and performance in the laboratory to the nutritional landscape available in the field.
                
                
                  
                    Oedaleus senegalensis
                    is a non‐model locust, a grass‐feeder, and the main pest of millet, a subsistence crop in the Sahel. In this study, we examined dietary preference and locust performance across a range of protein:carbohydrate ratios using the Geometric Framework methodology. We then applied a fitness landscape approach to visualize these results with the plant nutrient contents available across four land‐use types: millet, groundnut, fallow, and grazed fields. Finally, we contrasted our results with locust distribution in the field. Several locust species (
                    O. senegalensis
                    included) exhibit density‐dependent colour polymorphism; thus, we also reported individual coloration (brown or green).

                    O. senegalensis
                    preferred moderately carbohydrate‐biased food 1:1.6 protein:carbohydrate ratio. All traits recorded (mass gain, development time, growth rate, moult success and performance index) were best near that ratio and declined on either side presenting a ‘hump‐shape’. Fallow fields contained more plants, particularly grasses, that were both abundant and closer to the optimal protein:carbohydrate ratio recorded from the laboratory experiments.
                  
                
                
                  
                    When we surveyed
                    O. senegalensis
                    abundance and proportion, we found that they were more numerous in the fallow fields. Brown morph individuals, the ones associated with high density, were proportionally more abundant in fallow fields than green individuals.
                  
                
                
                  Our study provides evidence that variation in nutritional landscapes – relative to an herbivore's optimal nutrient balance – is a key driver of herbivore population distribution and abundance, and can be used to predict bottom‐up effects on herbivore species.

                  L'accès à des aliments de qualité est l'une des forces motrices de la dynamique des populations. Pour les herbivores, les protéines et les glucides sont des nutriments clés notoirement variables dans les plantes, et qui sont affectés par l'utilisation des sols. Cependant, peu d'études ont établies un lien entre les décisions nutritionnelles, les performances au laboratoire, et l'environnement nutritionnel sur le terrain.
                
                
                  
                    Oedaleus senegalensis
                    est un sauteriau se nourrissant de graminées et le principal ravageur du millet, une espèce vivrière. Dans cette étude, nous reportons pour la première fois ses préférences en protéines et en glucides, ainsi que ses performances pour plusieurs ratios de protéines et de glucides en utilisant la méthode du « Geometric Framework». Nous avons ensuite appliqué un paysage adaptif pour visualiser ces résultats avec les nutriments contenus dans les plantes de quatre types d'utilisation des sols: champs de millet, champs d'arachide, jachères, et pâturages. Finalement nous avons comparé nos paysages adaptifs avec la distribution d'
                    O. senegalensis
                    sur le terrain. Plusieurs espèces de locustes (incluant
                    O. senegalensis
                    ) présentent un polymorphisme de couleur qui dépend de la densité, donc nous avons également indiqué la coloration des criquets (brune ou verte).
                  
                
                
                  
                    Nous avons trouvé que
                    O. senegalensis
                    préférait et performait mieux avec des aliments modérément riches en glucides: 1:1.6 ratio de protéines:glucides. Toutes les variables que nous avons mesurées étaient meilleures autour de ce ratio et diminuaient en s'en éloignant. Nous avons trouvé que les jachères contenaient plus de plantes, des graminées en particulier, qui étaient à la fois abondantes et proches de ce ratio optimal de protéines et de glucides obtenu avec les expériences de laboratoire.
                  
                
                
                  Lorsque nous avons mesures la distribution et l'abondance d'O. senegalensis, nous avons trouvé qu'ils étaient plus nombreux dans les jachères. Nous avons trouvé que les spécimens bruns, ceux associés avec de fortes densités, étaient proportionnellement plus nombreux dans les jachères que les spécimens verts.
                
                
                  Notre étude établit que la variation dans le paysage nutritionnel ‐en comparaison avec la balance optimale en nutriments d'un herbivore‐ est une force majeure dans la distribution et l'abondance des populations, et peut être utilisée pour prédire les effets ascendants écologiques sur les populations d'herbivores.

                  Our study provides evidence that variation in nutritional landscapes – relative to an herbivore's optimal nutrient balance – is a key driver of herbivore population distribution and abundance, and can be used to predict bottom‐up effects on herbivore species.

            Résumé
            
              
                
                  L'accès à des aliments de qualité est l'une des forces motrices de la dynamique des populations. Pour les herbivores, les protéines et les glucides sont des nutriments clés notoirement variables dans les plantes, et qui sont affectés par l'utilisation des sols. Cependant, peu d'études ont établies un lien entre les décisions nutritionnelles, les performances au laboratoire, et l'environnement nutritionnel sur le terrain.
                
                
                  
                    Oedaleus senegalensis
                    est un sauteriau se nourrissant de graminées et le principal ravageur du millet, une espèce vivrière. Dans cette étude, nous reportons pour la première fois ses préférences en protéines et en glucides, ainsi que ses performances pour plusieurs ratios de protéines et de glucides en utilisant la méthode du « Geometric Framework». Nous avons ensuite appliqué un paysage adaptif pour visualiser ces résultats avec les nutriments contenus dans les plantes de quatre types d'utilisation des sols: champs de millet, champs d'arachide, jachères, et pâturages. Finalement nous avons comparé nos paysages adaptifs avec la distribution d'
                    O. senegalensis
                    sur le terrain. Plusieurs espèces de locustes (incluant
                    O. senegalensis
                    ) présentent un polymorphisme de couleur qui dépend de la densité, donc nous avons également indiqué la coloration des criquets (brune ou verte).
                  
                
                
                  
                    Nous avons trouvé que
                    O. senegalensis
                    préférait et performait mieux avec des aliments modérément riches en glucides: 1:1.6 ratio de protéines:glucides. Toutes les variables que nous avons mesurées étaient meilleures autour de ce ratio et diminuaient en s'en éloignant. Nous avons trouvé que les jachères contenaient plus de plantes, des graminées en particulier, qui étaient à la fois abondantes et proches de ce ratio optimal de protéines et de glucides obtenu avec les expériences de laboratoire.
                  
                
                
                  Lorsque nous avons mesures la distribution et l'abondance d'O. senegalensis, nous avons trouvé qu'ils étaient plus nombreux dans les jachères. Nous avons trouvé que les spécimens bruns, ceux associés avec de fortes densités, étaient proportionnellement plus nombreux dans les jachères que les spécimens verts.
                
                
                  Notre étude établit que la variation dans le paysage nutritionnel ‐en comparaison avec la balance optimale en nutriments d'un herbivore‐ est une force majeure dans la distribution et l'abondance des populations, et peut être utilisée pour prédire les effets ascendants écologiques sur les populations d'herbivores.

	abstract = {Global climate change is altering precipitation patterns. The effect of water stress on plant–herbivore interactions is poorly understood even though this is a primary ecological interaction that will be altered by climate change. This is especially true for grasslands where water is often limiting. In this study we manipulated water inputs in open grassland plots (1 m
              2
              ) during a severe drought and assessed plant and insect herbivore responses. There were two watering treatments: ambient and supplemented. Supplemented plots received water weekly in amounts that mimicked average seasonal rainfall. For plants, we were interested in how water input affected protein and digestible carbohydrate content; previous studies predicted water stress would increase the concentration of these two nutrients. Grasshoppers are the dominant insect herbivores in grasslands and we assessed their responses to water inputs by measuring abundance and diversity. Previous studies suggested grasshoppers would prefer water‐stressed plots. Protein and carbohydrate content in bulk grass and forb samples, plus plant biomass and diversity, were measured monthly (May–August). Immediately prior to harvesting plant tissue, we counted and identified individual grasshoppers in each plot. Grass biomass was reduced with water stress, but macronutrient content and species diversity were unaffected. After three months water‐stressed forbs were less protein biased, and diverse, relative to watered forbs; forb biomass was indistinguishable between treatments. Grasshopper abundance and diversity were lower in water‐stressed plots as the season progressed. However, grasshopper‐feeding biology mattered: densities of mixed‐feeders and grass‐feeders, but not forb‐specialists, decreased over time in water‐stressed plots, but not in water supplemented plots. Our results demonstrate the importance of focusing on plant and insect herbivore functional groups and provide valuable new data that can be incorporated into models to explore the effects of global climate change in greater detail.},

	abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

Epicormic buds sprouted following bouts of defoliation and the first epicormic leaves produced from such buds were rich in nitrogen and particularly in nitrogenous solutes such as proline compared with adult leaves. Xylem sap collected from declining trees was richer in nitrogenous solutes than that from healthy trees. Concentrations of total nitrogen and specific solutes in foliage were not closely related to pressure potential in shoots or to nitrogen availability in soil. In glasshouse-grown seedlings, foliar concentrations of total nitrogen and of a number of nitrogenous solutes were increased by reduced water availability. Chronic insect infestations and periodic insect outbreaks may be supported by high concentrations of nitrogenous solutes in sap and foliage, especially epicormic foliage, which in turn may be a response to drought or increasing salinity ('physiological drought').},

	abstract = {Abstract. Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management. The full ERA5-Land hourly (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019a) and monthly (Muñoz-Sabater, 2019b) averaged datasets presented in this paper are available through the C3S Climate Data Store at https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.e2161bac and https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.68d2bb30, respectively.},

                  Herbivores face various nutritional challenges in their life cycles, challenges that may become increasingly acute under ongoing environmental changes.
                
                
                  Here, focusing on calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen, we used nutritional geometry to analyse individual‐based data on foraging and extraction efficiencies, and combined these with data on reproduction and migratory behaviour to understand how a large herbivorous carnivore can complete its life cycle on a narrow and seemingly low quality bamboo diet.
                
                
                  Behavioural results showed that pandas during the year switched between four main food categories involving the leaves and shoots of two bamboo species available. Nutritional analysis suggests that these diet shifts are related to the concentrations and balances of calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen. Notably, successive shifts in range use and food type corresponded with a transition to higher concentrations and/or a more balanced intake of these multiple key constituents.
                
                
                  Our study suggests that pandas obligatorily synchronize their seasonal migration and reproduction with the disjunct nutritional phenologies of two bamboo species. This finding has potentially important implications for habitat conservation for this species and, more generally, draws attention to the need for understanding the nutritional basis of food selection in devising management plans for endangered species.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Australia, the flattest, driest, and geologically oldest vegetated continent, has a uniquely high proportion of nutrient‐poor soils. We develop a “Nutrient‐Poverty/Intense‐Fire Theory,” which postulates that most anomalous features of organisms and ecosystems of Australia are the evolutionary consequences of adaptations to nutrient poverty, compounded by intense fire that tends to occur as a result of nutrient poverty. The fundamental tenet of the theory is that plants growing in environments with plentiful light and periodic adequate moisture, but on soils poor in phosphorus, zinc, and other indispensible nutrients, can synthesize carbohydrates in excess of the amount that can be combined with, or catalyzed by, these nutrients for metabolism and production of nutrient‐rich foliage and reproductive tissues. They use this “expendable energy” to produce well‐defended foliage, large quantities of lignified tissues, and readily digestible exudates. Rapid accumulation of nutrient‐poor biomass, a result of low rates of herbivory, provides fuel for intense fire. Intense fire exacerbates nutrient poverty by volatilizing certain micronutrients critical for animals. Anomalous features of organisms of Australia that can be explained by this theory, rather than by climate or phylogenetic history alone, include the following: most woody plants have long‐lived, durable foliage; plants defend their tissues primarily with carbon‐rich but nutrient‐poor compounds; an unusually high proportion of plants protects seeds from fire and granivores in sturdy, woody capsules or follicles; plants allocate unusually large amounts of expendable energy to production of carbon‐based exudates, such as nectar and gums; an unusually high proportion of plant species is pollinated by vertebrates that average larger size than pollinators on other continents; herbivores are small and have slow metabolism; there are no ruminants, mammals that eat mainly subterranean plant matter, or fungus‐culturing termites and ants; vegetation dominated by leaf‐spinescent plants is more extensive than vegetation dominated by stem‐spinescent plants; nitrogen‐fixing plants are major components of most vegetation types; there is a higher proportion of myrmecochorous plant species than on any other continent; there are hardly any stem‐succulent and few leaf‐succulent, perennial, non‐halophytic plant species; and an unusually high proportion of bird species breeds cooperatively. Although the Nutrient‐Poverty/Intense‐Fire Theory can provide plausible explanations for these anomalous features, some puzzles remain, among them the great success of introduced herbivores, the lack of grazers on extensive grasslands on cracking clays, the apparently low productivity of ants, and the prominence of the parasitic plants of Australia. By examining the ratios of available energy to nutrients, particularly scarce nutrients, ecologists may identify processes not previously recognized as important for life forms or biotic adaptation on other continents.},

                  Grazing lawns are grassland areas where regular grazing by mammalian herbivores creates patches of short‐statured, high nutrient vegetation. Grazing lawns are predictable microsites that modify microclimate, plant structure, community composition, and nutrient availability, with likely repercussions for arthropod communities.
                
                
                  One year of our study occurred during an extreme drought. Drought mimics some of the effects of mammalian grazers: decreasing above‐ground plant biomass while increasing plant foliar percentage nitrogen.
                
                
                  We sampled arthropods and nutrient availability on and nearby (“off”) 10 bison‐grazed grazing lawns in a tallgrass prairie in NE Kansas. Total grasshopper abundance was higher on grazing lawns and the magnitude of this difference increased in the wetter year of 2019 compared to 2018, when drought led to high grass foliar nitrogen concentrations on and off grazing lawns. Mixed‐feeding grasshopper abundances were consistently higher on grazing lawns while grass‐feeder and forb‐feeder abundances were higher on lawns only in 2019, the wetter year. In contrast, the abundance of other arthropods (e.g., Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, and Araneae) did not differ on and off lawns, but increased overall in 2019, relative to the drought of 2018.
                
                
                  Understanding these local scale patterns of abundances and community composition improves predictability of arthropod responses to ongoing habitat change.},

            Migration is an energetically taxing phenomenon as animals move across vast, heterogeneous landscapes where the cost of transport is impacted by permissible ambient conditions. In this study, we assessed the energetic demands of long-distance migration in a multigenerational ectothermic migrant, the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). We tested the hypotheses that temperature-dependent physiological processes reduce energy reserves faster during migration than previously estimated, and that increasing climatic temperatures resulting from the climate crisis will intensify baseline daily energy expenditure. First, we reared monarchs under laboratory conditions to assess energy and mass conversion from fifth instar to adult stages, as a baseline for migratory adult mass and ontogenetic shifts in metabolic rate from larvae to adult. Then, using historical tag–recapture data, we estimated the movement propensity and migratory pace of autumn migrants using computer simulations and subsequently calculated energy expenditure. Finally, we estimated the energy use of monarchs based on these tag–recapture data and used this information to estimate daily energy expenditure over a 57 year period. We found support for our two hypotheses, noting that incorporating standard metabolic rate into estimates of migratory energy expenditure shows higher energy demand and that daily energy expenditure has been gradually increasing over time since 1961. Our study shows the deleterious energetic consequences under current climate change trajectories and highlights the importance of incorporating energetic estimates for understanding migration by small, ectothermic migrants.},

              Although phosphorus has long been considered an important factor in the growth of diverse biota such as bacteria, algae, and zooplankton, insect nutrition has classically focused on dietary protein and energy content. However, research in elemental stoichiometry has suggested that primary producer biomass has similar N:P ratios in aquatic and terrestrial systems, and phosphorus‐rich herbivores in freshwater systems frequently face phosphorus‐limited nutritional conditions. Therefore, herbivorous insects should also be prone to phosphorus limitation. We tested this prediction by rearing
              Manduca sexta
              larvae on artificial and natural (
              Datura wrightii
              leaves) diets containing varying levels of phosphorus (approximately 0.20, 0.55, or 1.2\% phosphorus by dry weight). For both artificial and natural diets, increased dietary phosphorus significantly increased growth rates and body phosphorus contents, and shortened the time to the final instar molt. Caterpillars did not consistently exhibit compensatory feeding for phosphorus on either type of diet. The growth and body phosphorus responses were not explicable by changes in amounts of potassium or calcium, which co‐varied with phosphorus in the diets. Concentrations of phosphorus in
              D. wrightii
              leaves collected in the field varied over a range in which leaf phosphorus is predicted to affect
              M. sexta
              's growth rates. These results suggest that natural variation in dietary phosphorus is likely to affect the growth rate and population dynamics of

            We present and apply to data for insects, chickens and rats a conceptual and experimental framework for studying nutrition as a multi-dimensional phenomenon. The framework enables the unification within a single geometrical model of several nutritionally relevant measures, including: the optimal balance and amounts of nutrients required by an animal in a given time (the intake target), the animal's current state in relation to these requirements, available foods, the amounts of ingested nutrients which are retained and eliminated, and animal performance. Animals given a nutritionally balanced food, or two or more imbalanced but complementary foods, can satisfy their nutrient requirements, and hence optimize performance. However, animals eating noncomplementary imbalanced foods must decide on a suitable compromise between overingesting some nutrients and underingesting others. The geometrical models provide a means of measuring nutritional targets and rules of compromise, and comparing these among different animals and within similar animals at different developmental stages or in different environments. They also provide a framework for designing and interpreting experiments on the regulatory and metabolic mechanisms underlying nutritional homeostasis.},

              Biogeochemistry and population biology have developed independently, with few attempts at linkage, almost none of which were mechanistically based. We hypothesize that biogeochemical cycling is linked to herbivore population dynamics through the influence of soil nutrient availability on foliar nutrient content, which constrains herbivore investment in phosphorus (P)‐rich molecules necessary for growth. We show that variation in desert soil P availability is linked to abundance of an insect herbivore (
              Sabinia setosa
              ) through the influence of soil P on the C:P ratio of the host plant (
              Prosopis velutina
              ). Low P availability increases C:P ratio of
              Prosopis
              leaves, leading to a decline in body \%P, \%RNA and abundance of
              Sabinia
              . Tight association between soil, plant and herbivore P provides the first evidence of a mechanistic pathway linking P biogeochemistry to terrestrial food webs by altering the supply of dietary P to herbivores, thus limiting their capacity for growth by constraining the production of P‐rich cellular ribosomal RNA (rRNA).},

The diets represented combinations of two protein and two digestible carbohydrate levels (28\% and 14\% dry weight) presented in an otherwise complete nutrient mix. At the nutrient levels used, locusts regulated their intake of food with respect to protein but not digestible carbohydrate in the diet. They ate more of the lower protein diets by eating the same sized meals more frequently than insects fed on the higher protein diets. Compensation was not complete over the 12 h observation period: insects on the lower‐protein diets ingested and absorbed 72\% as much nitrogen as those insects fed on the higher‐protein diets. Possible physiological mechanisms underlying the behavioural mechanisms are discussed.},

The book provides a comprehensive theoretical approach to the analysis of nutrition—the Geometric Framework. The book shows how it can help us to understand the links between nutrition and the biology of individual animals, including the physiological mechanisms that determine the nutritional interactions of the animal with its environment, and the consequences of these interactions in terms of health, immune responses, and lifespan. The book explains how these effects translate into the collective behavior of groups and societies, and in turn influence food webs and the structure of ecosystems. It then demonstrates how the Geometric Framework can be used to tackle issues in applied nutrition, such as the problem of optimizing diets for livestock and endangered species, and how it can also help to address the epidemic of human obesity and metabolic disease.},

            Locusts have been reported to elevate metabolic rate in response to high carbohydrate diets; this conclusion was based on metabolic rates calculated from CO2 production, a common practice for insects. However, respiratory exchange ratio (RER, CO2 production divided by O2 consumption) can rise above 1 as a result of de novo lipid synthesis, providing an alternative possible explanation of the prior findings. We studied the relationship between macronutrient ingestion, RER and lipid synthesis using South American locusts (Schistocerca cancellata) reared on artificial diets varying in protein:carbohydrate (p:c) ratio. RER increased and rose above 1 as dietary p:c ratio decreased. Lipid accumulation rates were strongly positively correlated with dietary carbohydrate content and ingestion. RERs above 1 were only observed for animals without food in the respirometry chamber, suggesting that hormonal changes after a meal may drive lipid synthesis. Schistocerca cancellata does not elevate metabolic rate on low p:c diets; in fact, the opposite trend was observed.},

          Organisms require dietary macronutrients in specific ratios to maximize performance, and variation in macronutrient requirements plays a central role in niche determination. Although it is well-recognized that development and body size can have strong and predictable effects on many aspects of organismal function, we lack a predictive understanding of ontogenetic or scaling effects on macronutrient intake. We determined protein and carbohydrate intake throughout development on lab populations of locusts and tested whether lab responses can predict results for field populations. Self-selected protein:carbohydrate targets declined dramatically through ontogeny, due primarily to declines in mass-specific protein consumption rates which were highly correlated with declines in specific growth rates. Importantly, lab results for protein consumption rates predicted results for field-collected locusts. However, field locusts consumed nearly double the carbohydrate, likely due to higher activity and metabolic rates. Combining our results with the available data for animals, both across species and during ontogeny, protein consumption scaled predictably and hypometrically, demonstrating a new scaling rule key for understanding nutritional ecology.},

            Migration allows animals to track favorable environments and avoid harmful conditions. However, migration is energetically costly, so migrating animals must prepare themselves by increasing their energy stores. Despite the importance of locust migratory swarms, we still understand little about the physiology of locust migration. During long-distance flight, locusts rely on lipid oxidation, despite the fact that lipids are relatively rare in their leaf-based diets. Therefore, locusts and other insect herbivores synthesize and store lipid from ingested carbohydrates, which are also important for initial flight. These data suggest that diets high in carbohydrate should increase lipid stores and the capacity for migratory flight in locusts. As predicted, locust lipid stores and flight performance increased with an increase in the relative carbohydrate content in their food. However, locust flight termination was not associated with complete lipid depletion. We propose potential testable mechanisms that might explain how macronutrient consumption can affect flight endurance.},

Understanding their large‐scale and long‐term dynamics is necessary to develop effective control and management strategies. Occupancy models represent a promising approach to unravel interactions between environmental factors and spatiotemporal dynamics of outbreaking populations. Here, we investigated population dynamics of the Australian plague locust,
              Chortoicetes terminifera

              in eastern Australia. We applied multistate and autologistic multi‐season occupancy models to test competing hypotheses about environmental and demographic processes affecting the large‐scale dynamics of the Australian plague locust. We found that rainfall and land cover predictors best explained the spatial variability in outbreak probability across eastern Australia. Outbreaks are more likely to occur in temperate than tropical regions, with a faster and more continuous response to rainfall in desert than in agricultural areas. Our results also support the hypothesis that migration tends to propagate outbreaks only locally (over distances lower than 400 km) rather than across climatic regions. Our study suggests that locust outbreak forecasting and management systems could be improved by implementing key environmental factors and migration in hierarchical spatial models. Finally, our modeling framework can be seen as a step towards bridging the gap between mechanistic and more phenomenological models in the spatial analysis of fluctuating populations.},

Mechanisms that drive P limitation, and their interactions with the N cycle, have received less attention than mechanisms causing N limitation. We identify and discuss six mechanisms that could drive P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems. The best known of these is depletion‐driven limitation, in which accumulated P losses during long‐term soil and ecosystem development contribute to what Walker and Syers termed a “terminal steady state” of profound P depletion and limitation. The other mechanisms are soil barriers that prevent access to P; transactional limitation, in which weathering of P‐containing minerals does not keep pace with the supply of other resources; low‐P parent materials; P sinks; and anthropogenic changes that increase the supply of other resources (often N) relative to P. We distinguish proximate nutrient limitation (which occurs where additions of a nutrient stimulate biological processes, especially productivity) from ultimate nutrient limitation (where additions of a nutrient can transform ecosystems). Of the mechanisms that drive P limitation, we suggest that depletion, soil barriers, and low‐P parent material often cause ultimate limitation because they control the ecosystem mass balance of P. Similarly, demand‐independent losses and constraints to N fixation can control the ecosystem‐level mass balance of N and cause it to be an ultimate limiting nutrient.},

                  We investigate where bottom‐up and top‐down control regulates ecological communities as a mechanism linking ecological gradients to the geography of consumer abundance and biomass. We use standardized surveys of 54 North American grasslands to test alternate hypotheses predicting 100‐fold shifts in the biomass of four common grassland arthropod taxa—Auchenorrhyncha, sucking herbivores, Acrididae, chewing herbivores, Tettigoniidae, omnivores, and Araneae, predators.
                
                
                  Bottom‐up models predict that consumer biomass tracks plant quantity (e.g. productivity and standing biomass) and quality (nutrient content) and that ectotherm access to food increases with temperature. Each of the focal trophic groups responded differently to these drivers: the biomass of sucking herbivores and omnivores increased with plant biomass; that of chewing herbivores tracked plant quality; and predator biomass did not depend on plant quality, plant quantity or temperature.
                
                
                  The Exploitation Ecosystem Hypothesis is a top‐down hypothesis that predicts a shift from resource limitation of herbivores when plant production is low, to predator limitation when plant production is high. In grasslands where spider biomass was low, herbivore biomass increased with plant biomass, whereas bottom‐up structuring was not evident when spiders were abundant. Furthermore, neither predator biomass nor trophic position (via stable isotope analysis) increased with plant biomass, suggesting predators themselves are top‐down limited.
                
                
                  Stable isotope analysis revealed that trophic position of the chewing herbivore and omnivore increased significantly with plant biomass, suggesting these groups increased scavenging and meat consumption in grasslands with higher carbohydrate availability.
                
                
                  Taken together, our snapshot sampling documents gradients of food web structure across 54 grasslands, consistent with multiple hypotheses of bottom‐up and top‐down regulation.},

Additionally, when considering long-term trends driven by climate, one must account for large-scale oscillations including El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We combine long-term datasets of grasshopper abundance, climate, plant biomass, and end-of-season foliar elemental content to examine potential drivers of abundance cycles and trends of this dominant herbivore. Annual grasshopper abundances in 16- and 22-y time series from a Kansas prairie revealed both 5-y cycles and declines of 2.1–2.7\%/y. Climate cycle indices of spring ENSO, summer NAO, and winter or spring PDO accounted for 40–54\% of the variation in grasshopper abundance, mediated by effects of weather and host plants. Consistent with ND, grass biomass doubled and foliar concentrations of N, P, K, and Na—nutrients which limit grasshopper abundance—declined over the same period. The decline in plant nutrients accounted for 25\% of the variation in grasshopper abundance over two decades. Thus a warming, wetter, more CO

            More and more studies are demonstrating that populations of animals ‐ from herbivores to top predators, vertebrates and invertebrates ‐ are limited by their food, and that the availability of this food is dictated by the weather. Satellite monitoring is revealing how cyclic and quasi‐cyclic climatic patterns, like the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation, are driving and synchronising these weather‐driven changes in the supplies of food. Changes in the amount of food available operate to limit the abundance of populations largely through their influence on the survival of the very young: the Achilles heel of all populations.
            Any individual organism struggles to use whatever resources it can get from a mostly inhospitable environment to maximise the proliferation of its genes. Each level of a food chain is thus dependent upon, and pressing hard against the limits set by the one below. The resulting intra‐ and inter‐specific interactions produce a multitude of complex outcomes, that significantly influence the dynamics of populations, but do not determine their ultimate size. There is no density‐dependent regulation of abundance. Intra‐specific competition does not determine the size of populations, it only decides which few individuals gain access to the limited food. Nor do predators regulate their prey. They, too, are limited by their food, and the abundance and quality of food is dictated by the weather.},

                  Nutrition has far‐reaching effects on both the ecology and evolution of species. A substantial body of work has examined the role of host plant quality on insect herbivores, with a particular focus on specialist–generalist dynamics, the interaction of growth and other physiological attributes on fitness and tritrophic effects. Measures of plant quality usually involve one or two axes of nutritional space: typically secondary metabolites or elemental proxies (N and C) of protein and carbohydrates, respectively.
                
                
                  
                    Here, we describe the nutrient space of seven host plants of the specialist insect herbivore,
                    Manduca sexta
                    , using an approach that measures physiologically relevant sources of nutrition, soluble protein and digestible carbohydrates. We show that plant species differ markedly in their nutrient content, offering developing insect herbivores a range of available nutrient spaces that also depend on the age of the leaves being consumed.
                  
                
                
                  
                    The majority of host‐plant species produce diets that are suboptimal to the herbivore, likely resulting in varying levels of compensatory feeding for
                    M. sexta
                    to reach target levels of protein to ensure successful growth and development. Low‐quality diets can also impact immune function leading to complex patterns of optimization of plant resources that maximizes both growth and the ability to defend from parasitoids and pathogens. This study is the first to quantify the nutrient space of a suite of host plants used by an insect herbivore using physiologically relevant measures of nutrition.},

	abstract = {1. Adaptive phenotypic plasticity has been a major subject in evolutionary ecology, but how a species' behaviour may respond to certain environmental change is still not clear. In grasslands worldwide, large herbivores are increasingly used as a tool for grazing management, and occur to interact with grasshoppers that dominate grassland insect communities. Previous studies have been well‐documented about grazing effects on diversity and abundance of grasshoppers. Yet, how grazing may alter grasshopper behaviour, and potential effects on their abundance remains elusive.
            
              2. We conducted a field experiment by manipulating grazing using sheep, cattle, and their mix to examine the behavioural responses and abundance of the grasshoppers (
              Euchorthippus unicolor
              ) to grazing in a
              Leymus chinensis
              ‐dominated grassland.
            
            3. Results showed that the grasshoppers spent less time on feeding and resting on grasses, but more time on switching and resting on forbs under cattle grazing and mixed grazing with cattle and sheep. In contrast, the grasshoppers spent more time on feeding but less time on switching and resting on forbs under sheep grazing. The behavioural changes were also potentially linked to grasshopper abundance in the context of grazing management.
            4. The responses of grasshopper behaviour and abundance to grazing may be largely triggered by altered vegetation and microclimates. Such behavioural flexibility of grasshoppers must be considered when large herbivores are recognised as a management tool for influencing grasshopper abundance, and grazer species should be paid more attention both individually and jointly for better grassland conservation.},

                  Classic theory holds that the main interaction within the herbivore guild is competition, based on research focused on co‐occurring, similarly sized species that reduce the quantity of shared plant resources. However, plant quality may also be crucial in mediating herbivore interspecific interactions. This is especially true when competition occurs between distantly related herbivore species, given that small terrestrial herbivores (e.g., insect herbivores) appear to be more sensitive to alterations of plant quality than plant quantity.
                
                
                  
                    In this study, we first tested in the field whether large vertebrate herbivores (cattle
                    Bos taurus
                    ) exerted a negative effect on smaller insect herbivores (grasshopper
                    Euchorthippus
                    unicolor
                    ) through their overlapping foraging preferences for a dominant grass
                    Leymus chinensis
                    . We measured changes in grass quantity, grass quality, and microclimatic conditions in response to vertebrate grazing and conducted additional manipulative studies in the field and the laboratory to identify potential mechanisms underlying the interaction.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Our results showed that grazing by large herbivores caused a significant decline in grasshopper population density and individual performance (survival, size, and weight of both female and male
                    E. unicolor
                    ), despite a 38\% increase in grass nitrogen (N) content in grazed plots. Experiments manipulating N levels of
                    L. chinensis
                    in the field and the laboratory confirmed that enriching plant N had a negative effect on grasshopper individual performance and population size. Therefore, enhanced quality (N content) of plant resources appears to be an important driver in mediating the negative effect of vertebrate grazing on grasshoppers.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis.
                    We document that phylogenetic relatedness and trait similarity can be poor predictors of interaction strength in some cases, since distantly related herbivores of disparate size can interact indirectly via changes in plant quality. Counter‐intuitively, the observed negative effect of cattle on grasshoppers was mediated, at least in part, by an increase in plant quality in cattle grazed areas. The implication is that light to moderate grazing, a common management strategy, may contribute to suppression of grasshoppers in the Eurasian steppe grassland system by altering plant nutrient supplies.},

abstract = {Abstract Dietary restriction (DR) is the most consistent environmental manipulation to extend lifespan. Originally thought to be caused by a reduction in caloric intake, recent evidence suggests that macronutrient intake underpins the effect of DR. The prevailing evolutionary explanations for the DR response are conceptualized under the caloric restriction paradigm, necessitating reconsideration of how or whether these evolutionary explanations fit this macronutrient perspective. In the authors’ opinion, none of the current evolutionary explanations of DR adequately explain the intricacies of observed results; instead a context-dependent combination of these theories is suggested which is likely to reflect reality. In reviewing the field, it is proposed that the ability to track the destination of different macronutrients within the body will be key to establishing the relative roles of the competing theories. Understanding the evolution of the DR response and its ecological relevance is critical to understanding variation in DR responses and their relevance outside laboratory environments.},

    abstract = { Many theoretical treatments of foraging use energy as currency, with carbohydrates and lipids considered interchangeable as energy sources. However, herbivores must often synthesize lipids from carbohydrates since they are in short supply in plants, theoretically increasing the cost of growth. We tested whether a generalist insect herbivore (Locusta migratoria) can improve its growth efficiency by consuming lipids, and whether these locusts have a preferred caloric intake ratio of carbohydrate to lipid (C : L). Locusts fed pairs of isocaloric, isoprotein diets differing in C and L consistently selected a 2C : 1L target. Locusts reared on isocaloric, isoprotein 3C : 0L diets attained similar final body masses and lipid contents to locusts fed the 2C : 1L diet, but they ate more and had a ~12\% higher metabolic rate, indicating an energetic cost for lipogenesis. These results demonstrate that some animals can selectively regulate carbohydrate-to-lipid intake and that consumption of dietary lipids can improve growth efficiency. }
