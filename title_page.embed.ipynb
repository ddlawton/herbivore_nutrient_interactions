    "DL led the writing and data analysis with input from AC. AC and JL designed and carried out the field experiments. CW and SS helped with experimental design and provided logistical support in Australia. IT collected data and provided logistical support in Australia. NT oversaw and conducted all chemical analyses with support from JL. CH provided GIS and remote sensing support. AC originally conceived the field experiment ideas and methodology. TD and CA provided logistical support in identifying outbreaking locust bands throughout New South Wales, Australia. TD led data curation and interpretation of the historical locust dataset. All authors contributed to final manuscript preparation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Soil data is freely available and can be acquired on this website:  \n",
    "<https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/Public/Pages/SLGA/GetData.html>.  \n",
    "As per the Australian Plague Locust Commission guidelines, the Australian plague locust dataset cannot be made publicly available as it requires specific explanation to understand some aspects of its contents. Those who are interested in these data should submit a request to the APLC. All field population and cage experiment data will be made available on the github repo at the time of publication."
